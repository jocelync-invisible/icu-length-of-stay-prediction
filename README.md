# Bayesian ML Project
Team: Hidden-Layer-Heroes 

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Length of Stay (LOS) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using the mIMIC-III and mIMIC-IV datasets. The primary goal is to develop predictive models that can help healthcare professionals in estimating the length of a patient's stay in the ICU, aiding in resource allocation and decision-making.

## Dataset

This project uses the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV demo datasets, which are publicly available critical care data These datasets include various patient parameters, laboratory results, and demographic information.

To access the mIMIC datasets:

MIMIC-III: https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iii-clinical-database/1.4/

MIMIC-IV: https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv/1.0/

100 patients 

how did we merge the teables( patients+ICU stay+ micro)


Why & how use micro culture( Lab result) + demograghics 

## EDA

PCA dimentionality reductio and feature selction
random forest: feature importance


## Models

### Baysian linear regression

1. log and scale
2. build the model (explain the steps show snipet odcodes) explain the feature impotance
3. BLS result and visualization


### BNN (brief introduction)

log and scale
Build BNN( MC drop ou)
l2 vs l1 regulation (MSE vs MAE)
BNN result and visualization

### result interpretation and discussion of limitations

## Next Step
 Try differnt models(ie  nonnbaysain ones)
 Get more data from the MIMIC III and IV
