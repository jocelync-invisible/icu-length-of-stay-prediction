# Bayesian ML Project
Team: Hidden-Layer-Heroes 

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Length of Stay (LOS) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using the mIMIC-III and mIMIC-IV datasets. The primary goal is to develop predictive models that can help healthcare professionals in estimating the length of a patient's stay in the ICU, aiding in resource allocation and decision-making.

## Dataset

This project uses the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV demo datasets, which are publicly available critical care data These datasets include various patient parameters, laboratory results, and demographic information.

To access the mIMIC datasets:

MIMIC-III: https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iii-clinical-database/1.4/

MIMIC-IV: https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv/1.0/

100 patients 

how did we merge the teables( patients+ICU stay+ micro)


Why & how use micro culture( Lab result) + demograghics 

## EDA
Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Data
Step 2: Import and Inspect the Data
Step 3: Handling Missing Values
Step 4: Explore Data Characteristics
Step 5: Perform Data Transformation(log and scale)
Step 6: PCA  
Step 7: Visualize Data Relationships
Step 8: (Handling Outliers)
Step 9: Communicate Findings and Insights


## Models

### Baysian linear regression

1. build the model (explain the steps show snipet odcodes) explain the feature impotance, and what we did to optimize the performacne of BLR)
2. BLS result and visualization
3. result interpretation

### BNN (brief introduction)


1.Build BNN( MC drop ou)
2.l2 vs l1 regulation (MSE vs MAE)
3.BNN result and visualization
4.result interpretation

### result interpretation, comparison and discussion of limitations

## Next Step
 Try differnt models(ie  nonnbaysain ones)
 Get more data from the MIMIC III and IV
